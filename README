Introduction
------------

mdns allows a device to

-- Resolve its name to IP addresses for other nodes on the network
-- Advertise its services to other nodes

Building
--------

1. Set the build vars:
   $ export CC=your-compiler-cc
   $ export AR=your-compiler-ar
   $ export CFLAGS="cflags for your build"
   $ export OPTIONS="MDNS_LOG MDNS_DBG MDNS_TESTS MDNS_SYSTEM_LINUX"

Note: your OPTIONS may vary depending on how you wish to build mdns.  Edit the
Makefile to change the default options.  Also, when you change the
configuration options you must do a clean build.

2. Build

$ make

The mdns library can be found in mdns/libmdns.a.  The location of your
executable depends on which system you build for.  For linux, it appears in
examples/linux/mdns.

3. If you wish to only compile the mdns library:

$ make

Porting
-------

1. Add sections for your compiler and your system to include/mdns_port.h.  See
that file for details on exactly what standard C and BSD facilities are
required.

2. Build the mdns library as described above.  Be sure to set the build
variables properly for your new system and compiler.

3. Implement the porting functions described in include/mdns_port.h.  These
comprise the system-specific calls used by mdns.

4. Add calls to mdns_launch() and mdns_halt() at suitable points in your system
launch code to invoke and tear down the mdns task.  If you wish to run the test
suite against your ported code (which is recommended), you should wrap the
mdns_launch() function in such a way that you can invoke it with various
arguments from some sort of console.

5. You may wish to invoke mdns_test() somewhere if you built with the
MDNS_TESTS option.  The output of these tests is all text.  Each test that is
run reports either PASS or FAIL.

6. Build, deploy, and launch your system.

7. Test your system.  At the very least, you should be able to ping your system
at the hostname and domain that you passed to mdns_launch().  If you wish, you
may create a new test target for your device and run the automated system
tests.  See test/README for more detail.
