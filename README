oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Introduction
------------

Zeroconf is a suite of software that allows a user to:

-- Acquire an IP address in the event that no DHCP server is available (IPv4LL)
-- Resolve names to IP addresses (mDNS)
-- Discover services available on a network (DNS-SD)

The IPv4LL implementation is written from scratch by cozybit.  The mDNS and
DNS-SD implementations are a port of the Apple Darwin mDNSResponder code, which
is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.  In addition to the standard zeroconf
features, this suite implements a simple webserver that can be advertised using
mDNS.

Building
--------

The zerconf suite is based on the 8388V No Host SDK.  To build it, simply type
"make" in the Build directory of the SDK.  The output is an image called
nh8388v.axf that can be loaded into the 8388V RAM, or an image called csb0.bin
that can be loaded into flash using writespi.axf from Marvell.

Testing
-------

See test_framework for details on testing.

   interface.
-- Document link local interface
-- Document log interface
-- Document httpd interface
-- Create simple network manager?
-- Consolidate cozybits into their own directory
