Quick Start
===========

1: Install dependencies

sudo apt-get install python-nose python-dnspython

2: Run the tests

$ nosetests

Notes
=====

-- To see the stdout of the tests, invoke nosetests with -s

-- We use a slightly modified version of pxssh.py.  That's why it's here in the
   test dir instead of using the one that comes with python.

-- The linux tests require that you can ssh into the remote target without a
   password (i.e., your ssh-agent is set up properly).

-- If you use the "ControlMaster auto" option with your ssh client, you may get
   some unexpected failures from pxssh.

-- For some reason, the tests don't work on my Ubuntu dev machine unless I've
   got avahi up.  Not sure what's up with that.
