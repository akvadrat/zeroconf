vir8388.py -- 8388V serial console interface
			  this module provides a 'vir8388' object, which is an interface to
			  the 8388V serial debug console.  The constructor takes two 
			  optional arguments, 'port' and 'rate', whose defaults are
			  /dev/ttyS0 and 57600 respectively.

		methods:
			
			clear_buffer() -- reads and ignores anything in the serial input 
							  buffer, effectively 'flushing' it
			scan() -- performs a wireless network scan and returns a list of
					  AP SSIDs found or an empty list if none were found.
			set_ssid( ssid ) -- sets the 8388V's SSID
			set_tcp( ip, netmask, gateway ) -- sets up TCP
